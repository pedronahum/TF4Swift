TF4Swift Roadmap Feedback
Project Overview
TF4Swift is an early-stage Swift wrapper for TensorFlow's C Eager runtime, featuring code-generated operations, automatic differentiation shims for neural network primitives, and a clean API. It builds on past Swift for TensorFlow efforts, targets macOS/arm64 initially, and emphasizes ease of building/hacking with the stock Swift toolchain and Homebrew libtensorflow.
Current Roadmap
The roadmap is structured as sequential pull requests (PRs), with the first three completed:

PR-1: Eager core and minimal ops (e.g., Tensor creation, basic addition).
PR-2: _Raw namespace for non-throwing ops and ReLU auto-diff.
PR-3: Op generator polish, attribute defaults, and sigmoid/tanh with gradients.

Upcoming:

PR-4: Expand ops (arithmetic like Sub/Div, array ops like Reshape/Concat, NN ops like Conv2D).
PR-5: Higher-level APIs (e.g., Dense/Conv2D layers, SGD/Adam optimizers, Model protocol).
PR-6: UX and performance (error handling, logging, benchmarks).
PR-7: Portability and CI (Linux support, GitHub Actions).

North-star goals (post-MVP): Typed shapes, dataset utilities, export/import helpers, custom ops.
Suggested Changes to the Roadmap
I would make the following adjustments to prioritize broader usability, testing, and adoption while keeping the core technical progression intact. These changes aim to reduce risks like platform lock-in and improve community engagement earlier.
1. Reprioritize Portability (Move PR-7 Earlier)

Change: Shift PR-7 (Portability & CI) to follow PR-4, before higher-level APIs in PR-5.
Reason: Linux support and CI would enable wider testing/feedback during op expansion, attracting non-macOS contributors sooner. Delaying it risks macOS-specific bugs persisting into higher-level features, and early CI ensures stability as the op surface grows.

2. Add a New Milestone for Documentation and Examples

Change: Insert a new PR-8 after PR-5 (or integrate into PR-6), focused on comprehensive docs (e.g., API reference via Swift-DocC), tutorials (e.g., MNIST training example), and migration guides from deprecated Swift for TensorFlow.
Reason: The project lacks emphasis on user onboarding, which is critical for an early prototype to gain traction. This would complement the north-star goals and make the library more approachable, especially given its opinionated API.

3. Expand North-Star to Include GPU/Accelerator Integration

Change: Add explicit support for GPU/Metal acceleration (beyond current device listing) as a north-star item, including benchmarks against TensorFlow Python.
Reason: ML workloads demand hardware acceleration; while implied in the Eager core, prioritizing it post-MVP ensures performance parity and appeals to production users. Homebrew libtensorflow supports this on macOS, so it's feasible without major detours.

These tweaks maintain the roadmap's pragmatic, iterative focus while addressing potential gaps in scalability and user growth. No other major overhauls seem needed, as the current plan is well-structured for an MVP.
