# TF4Swift ‚Äî TensorFlow Eager in Swift (experimental)

> **Status:** early prototype. The API surface, module layout, and code generator are **subject to change** at any time. PRs welcome!

TF4Swift is a lightweight Swift wrapper around the TensorFlow **C Eager** runtime plus a code‚Äëgenerated set of Swift ops and hand‚Äërolled automatic differentiation (AD) shims for a growing subset of math/NN primitives.

The **north star** for this project is the original **[swift-apis]** effort from the Swift for TensorFlow era: a clean, Swift‚Äëfirst API layered over TensorFlow. Swift itself and the AD story have evolved since then; we‚Äôre also informed by the excellent **PassiveLogic Differentiable Swift** work and the ongoing language discussions in the Swift forums. Taken together, these let us re-think the layering and deliver a modern, pragmatic library that‚Äôs easy to build and hack on today.

## Why TF4Swift?

- **Low friction**: buildable with the stock Swift toolchain + Homebrew `libtensorflow` on macOS/arm64.
- **Familiar API**: `Tensor<T>` types, `Ops` builder, and a `_Raw` namespace for non-throwing convenience.
- **AD from day one**: `relu`, `sigmoid`, and `tanh` expose reverse‚Äëmode derivatives that compose with Swift‚Äôs `@differentiable` / pullback APIs.
- **Code generation**: Swift wrappers are emitted directly from TensorFlow‚Äôs `ops.pbtxt`, including defaulted attributes (e.g., `MatMul(transposeA: Bool = false, transposeB: Bool = false)`).
- **Opinionated but modular**: the generator writes small per‚Äëop files grouped by domain (Math / NN / Array) under `Sources/TF4SwiftOps/Generated`.

---

## Current capabilities

- **Core**: Eager context & device listing, `Tensor` creation from scalars/arrays, shape queries, simple broadcasting utilities, diagnostics with enriched TF error messages (op name/device).
- **Ops (generated)**: `AddV2`, `Mul`, `MatMul` (with defaulted transpose flags), `Relu`, `Sigmoid`, `Tanh` (+ `ReluGrad`, `SigmoidGrad`, `TanhGrad` behind `_Raw` for AD plumbing).
- **AD**: Hand‚Äëwritten `@derivative` wrappers for `relu`, `sigmoid`, `tanh` that call the TF gradient kernels and adapt to Swift‚Äôs `TangentVector`.
- **Tests**: end‚Äëto‚Äëend eager tests, broadcasting checks, and **golden tests** for the generator (verifying emitted signatures & builder calls). All pass on macOS/arm64 with Homebrew TF as of the latest commit.

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- macOS 13+ (Ventura) with Xcode command line tools
- Swift 6.2 toolchain (package uses `// swift-tools-version: 6.2`)
- Homebrew TensorFlow C runtime:

```bash
brew install libtensorflow
# Optional: override include/lib dirs if not using Homebrew defaults
export LIBTENSORFLOW_INCLUDEDIR="/opt/homebrew/opt/libtensorflow/include"
export LIBTENSORFLOW_LIBDIR="/opt/homebrew/opt/libtensorflow/lib"
```

### Build & test

```bash
# From repo root
swift build -c release
swift test
```

### Regenerate Swift op wrappers

```bash
# Wipe old generated sources (safe: only generated files live in this folder)
rm -rf Sources/TF4SwiftOps/Generated

# Rebuild the op generator and emit wrappers
swift run -c release tf4swift-opgen

# Rebuild & test with the new sources
swift build -c release
swift test
```

> If the generator can‚Äôt find `ops.pbtxt`, ensure it‚Äôs present at `Sources/TF4SwiftOpGen/ops.pbtxt`. The tool prints the resolved path on startup.

## Usage examples

### Elementwise add

```swift
import TF4SwiftCore
import TF4SwiftOps

let ctx = try EagerContext()
let ops = Ops(ctx)

let a = try Tensor<Float>([1, 2, 3, 4])
let b = try Tensor<Float>([10, 20, 30, 40])
let c = try ops.add(a, b)
print(try c.shape(), c.array)  // [4] [11, 22, 33, 44]
```

### MatMul with defaults

```swift
let a = try Tensor<Float>.fromArray([1,2,3,4,5,6], shape: [2,3])
let b = try Tensor<Float>.fromArray([7,8,9,10,11,12], shape: [3,2])
let c = try ops.matmul(a, b)  // transpose flags default to false
print(try c.shape())          // [2, 2]
```

### Differentiation: `sigmoid` and `tanh`

```swift
@differentiable(reverse) func f(_ x: Tensor<Float>) -> Tensor<Float> {
    sigmoid(x) + tanh(x)
}

let x = try Tensor<Float>(0.0)
let (y, pb) = valueWithPullback(at: x, of: f)

let seed = Tensor<Float>.TangentVector(try Tensor<Float>(1.0))
let g = pb(seed)
print(y.scalar)   // ~1.5
print(g.base!)    // ~1.25 at x=0 (sigmoid‚Äô=0.25, tanh‚Äô=1.0)
```

## Production‚Äëreadiness checklist

- [ ] Expand generated op coverage (see PR‚Äë4)
- [ ] Gradients for common ops; audit correctness via numeric checks
- [ ] Memory/lifetime audits around `TFE_TensorHandle*`
- [ ] Concurrency & Sendable annotations as needed
- [ ] Linux CI + documentation examples
- [ ] API review for source stability
- [ ] Versioning + semantic tags

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Duplicate rpath warnings**: benign on macOS; we embed multiple candidates for convenience.
- **`ops.pbtxt` not found**: ensure it exists under `Sources/TF4SwiftOpGen/ops.pbtxt`. Running `swift run -c release tf4swift-opgen` should print the resolved path.
- **‚Äúvalue of type 'Ops' has no member 'add'‚Äù**: make sure generated sources are present under `Sources/TF4SwiftOps/Generated` and that `_Raw.swift` routes through `Ops` methods with the expected signatures.
- **AD complaints (‚Äúexpression is not differentiable‚Äù)**: only call the public `relu/sigmoid/tanh` that are marked `@differentiable`. The `_Raw` helpers are intentionally not differentiated.

---

## Contributing

- Run `swift test` before submitting PRs.
- For new ops: extend the generator when possible; avoid hand‚Äëwritten wrappers unless the op requires special Swift surface.
- Keep generated files in `Sources/TF4SwiftOps/Generated` only; do not edit them by hand.
- Add tests (runtime or golden) alongside new functionality.
